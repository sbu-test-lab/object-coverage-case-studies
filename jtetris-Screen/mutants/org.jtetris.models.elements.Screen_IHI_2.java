/**
 * The playing screen is that portion of the actual computer screen in which
 * blocks can occur. It can be modelled by a grid object whose width is 10 and height
 * is 22. The occupied positions, corresponding to fallen blocks, form a contiguous
 * shape at the bottom of the screen
 * The playing screen is, therefore, modelled by a class Screen which inherits
 * Grid and set width to 10 and height to 22.
 * Initially, at the beginning of a game, the playing screen
 * will have no occupied positions. The class Screen has two main operations: AddBlock
 * corresponding to a block being added to the screen and RemoveRow correspond-
 * ing to a fully occupied row of the screen being removed.
